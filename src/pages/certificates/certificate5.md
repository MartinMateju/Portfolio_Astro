<!-- The Tactical Emergency Medical Technician (TEMT) certification trains healthcare professionals to provide advanced medical care in tactical and high-risk environments, such as law enforcement operations, military settings, or emergency response scenarios. TEMTs are trained to rapidly assess and treat traumatic injuries, stabilize patients in adverse conditions, and closely collaborate with tactical and rescue teams to ensure the safety and well-being of victims. -->
